# 🤗 Hugging Face Client

A desktop application for managing your Hugging Face repositories, files, and collections — built with PySide6 and the `huggingface_hub` library.  It provides a graphical user interface for common operations such as browsing your repos, managing files, editing READMEs, generating model cards, organizing collections and more!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- A [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join) and [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (with write permissions if you want to upload/edit)

### Installation

[coming soon]

### ▶️ Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

On first launch, click **Login** and enter your Hugging Face access token. If you've previously logged in via `huggingface-cli login`, the app will detect your cached token automatically.
